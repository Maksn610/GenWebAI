You are an expert content writer. Write a single-page website on the topic: "{topic}".
Use a {tone} tone.

Include the following sections in order:
- {sections_text}

Each section should have a heading (the section name) and a paragraph of content.

Here are examples to guide your writing:{examples_text}
